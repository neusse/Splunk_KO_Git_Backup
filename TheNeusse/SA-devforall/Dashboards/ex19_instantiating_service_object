                    <p>When you are connecting to Splunk using a Splunk SDK, a foundational object you need to have is the service object. For every scenario -other- than adding Javascript to a Splunk dashboard (e.g. SDKs for other languages, using SplunkJS on a non-Splunk server), you will get your service object by logging in -- pretty straightforward. And since you shouldn't need the service object inside of a Splunk dashboard, you should be fine leaving it there. However, there's <a href="http://dev.splunk.com/view/javascript-sdk/SP-CAAAEC9" target="_blank">several docs</a> and posts on Splunk Answers that use the service object. Who would we be to leave you high and dry, as we were for years?</p>

var splunkWebHttp = new splunkjs.SplunkWebHttp();
var service = new splunkjs.Service(splunkWebHttp);
