                    <p>If you are going to build a real application, you will want to be able to log events from it. Whether that's status events from the user side (maybe log messages, maybe audit events, etc.), or even ingesting data, logging events is key. Tom Martin from Splunk wrote a great function for this, which we'll use below to log each type of event. In this case, we're hardcoding index=main, sourcetype=sa-devforall:web_user, host=SA-devforall.</p>
                    <p>Notably, you might see a real-time search below. If you don't have rights to view a real-time search, we're using Javascript to automatically fall back to a periodic search. That said, we're kind to users, so we'll also run the search manually about 1 second after click any of the buttons, simulating the real-time capability, in addition to the 10 second refresh. (Why both? If you have a distributed environment, 1 second probably isn't enough to get the data from SH to Indexer to disk to search result.)</p>
