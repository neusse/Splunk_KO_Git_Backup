                    <p>Tokens are incredibly powerful tools due to their innate flexibility. The downside of that flexibility is that you can really drive yourself crazy with complex token setups that just cause failures that are a pain to troubleshoot. Fortunately, SplunkJS keeps a list of all the search managers that are active on a page, and the status for each one of those. This code will go pull out all the tokens that are being used in the searches, compare those tokens against the list of tokens that are set, and tell you which tokens are missing.</p>

                    <p>David built this code while troubleshooting tokens in Splunk Security Essentials, which is based on an early version of the Machine Learning Toolkit Showcase app, and contains 15 tokens on a single pane, many of them used for hidden search logics and | loadjobs. This has been super helpful to figure out what he did to break his code.</p>
