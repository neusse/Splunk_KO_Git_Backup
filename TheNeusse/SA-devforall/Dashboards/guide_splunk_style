                    <h3>Splunk Style Guidelines</h3>
                    <p>When <span class="author-veuve">I</span> started using Splunk, I googled for checkmark icons and red Xs and things like that. I struggled with figuring out how to make dropdowns that looked *just* so. Even as recently as half-way through the 2.0 redesign of Splunk Security Essentials, I was still using those weak techniques. Oh how little I knew!</p>
                    <p>Turns out, Splunk has shipped with style recommendations for a long time! Yes, on this instance you're at right now! Check it out! Be more effective more easily!</p>
