  After successfully on-boarding data from these four categories, you have achieved a great deal!
  <ul>
    <li>You are moving critical activity logs to a separate system where they can’t be easily tampered with by an attacker.</li>
    <li>You have the data necessary to enable you or a security specialist to perform basic investigations.</li>
    <li>You also have the raw materials to begin gaining a deeper understanding of the environment you must defend.</li>

<div id="stage1datasource"  data-translate-id="journey-stage1datasource" class="dontshow">

        that have been blocked.</td>
      <td>Endpoint logs complement network visibility to give insight into malicious activities such as malware execution, an insider performing an unauthorized activity, or an attacker dwelling in your network. It’s important to capture this data from both
        servers and workstations, and all operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.)</td>
      <td>Authentication logs can tell you when users are accessing your systems and applications, and from where. Since most successful attacks eventually include the use of valid credentials, this data is critical in helping to tell the difference between
        a valid login and an account takeover.</td>
      <td>Many attacks start with a user visiting a malicious website, or end with valuable data being exfiltrated to a site that the attacker controls. Visibility into who is accessing what sites and when is critical for investigation.</td>

<div id="stage2description"  data-translate-id="journey-stage2description" class="dontshow">
  This stage puts you in a position to begin implementing a Security Operations Center (SOC), to track systems and users on your network, and to consume a larger selection of detection mechanisms from vendors and the community. Even if you don’t plan to
  stand up a formal SOC, normalized data will streamline investigations and improve the effectiveness of an analyst.
</div>

<div id="stage2milestone"  data-translate-id="journey-stage2milestone" class="dontshow">
  <ul>
    <li id="cim_user_overview">Data is mapped properly to the <a href="">Common Information Model (CIM.)</a>
            </li>
    <li>Search performance can be improved dramatically through the use of accelerated data models associated with CIM.</li>
    <li>Asset and user details are correlated to events in your security log platform.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="stage2challenge"  data-translate-id="journey-stage2challenge" class="dontshow">
  Now that you have basic data and can search it in a standard way, you start to understand that some of the most effective security detections come from wire data and deeper endpoint visibility.
</div>

<div id="stage2datasource"  data-translate-id="journey-stage2datasource" class="dontshow">
  At this stage, you are ensuring your data is compliant with a standard security taxonomy. This means that that fields representing common values like source IP address, port, username, etc..., now have common names regardless of the device that created
  the event. This critical investment allows you to start consuming detection mechanisms from many sources and to begin to scale the capabilities of your security team.
  <p/> Additionally, you should gather reference information about your IT assets (systems, networks, devices, applications) and your user identities from Active Directory, LDAP, other IAM/SSO systems, etc... This data provides valuable enrichment to aid investigations
  and day-to-day analysis work.
</div>



<div id="stage3description"  data-translate-id="journey-stage3description" class="dontshow">

<div id="stage3milestone"  data-translate-id="journey-stage3milestone" class="dontshow">
  The foundations for advanced detections have been laid. You also now have the ability to match some common indicators of compromise (IOC).

  Machine data is important, but high performing security teams enrich their data with other internal and external sources. A wealth of contextual and investigative knowledge including threat intelligence feeds, open source intelligence (OSINT) sources,
